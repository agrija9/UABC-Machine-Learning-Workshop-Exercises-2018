#### UABC-Machine-Learning-Workshop-Exercises-2018

---

Machine learning scripts to perform regression, classification, clustering and data visualization using standard ML libraries such as sci-kit learn, pandas, seabron and google's tensorflow.

**Setting Up Environment** 

In order to run the jupyter notebooks from the exercises, it is required to have installed the following software/libraries in your computer:

- Ubuntu Linux (16.04 or 18.04) 
- Python 2.7 (or 3.6)
- Anaconda: [link to installation steps](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-anaconda-on-ubuntu-18-04-quickstart)
- Jupyter (comes with the Anaconda installation)
- Git clone this repo in your computer: [How to clone a repository in your computer](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
- [First create an Anaconda environment](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) and then install the following packages there 
	- [Numpy](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/numpy), Seaborn, Matplotlib, plotly, cufflinks, Pandas, Scikit
	- Tensorflow and Keras 

**Running the Jupyter Notebooks**

Once the environment is setup, you can launch each individual jupyter on your computer. 

1. Open a terminal in your computer
2. Navigate to your repository's folder: ```UABC-Machine-Learning-Workshop-Exercises-2018```
3. Activate the Anaconda environment you created (this will load the installed libraries)
4. Type the command ```jupyter```. This will open a localhost where you will be available to open each jupyter notebook. 

After this, you can run each cell from the notebooks, the exercises have been commented in order to be self explanatory. 



**Note:** Python 3.7 is not fully compatible with Tensorflow yet
